# Term_Deposit_Subscription_ML
Purpose: Our aim is to apply machine learning methods to predict whether bank clients will subscribe to term deposits, based on a comprehensive dataset. Approach: Utilize a combination of exploratory data analysis, statistical modeling, and advanced machine learning techniques to uncover patterns and predictors of subscription behavior.

Python files are named after every Question sequentially as mentioned below.
Questions:
1. (a) Perform and report exploratory data analytics in the data (e.g., visuals, descriptive statistics).
State any observations which are pertinent to the purpose of this report, i.e., to inform a
predictive model which can guide telephonic marketing.

2. (a) Fit a logistic regression model on the dataset. Choose a probability threshold of 1 0 % ,
20%, 35% and 50%, to assign an observation to the Term Deposit = 1 class. Compute a
confusion matrix for each of the probability thresholds. How do the True Positive and False
Positive rates vary over these probability thresholds? Which probability threshold would you
choose?
(b) Divide the dataset into training (70%) and test (30%) sets and repeat the above question and
report the performance of these models, across probability thresholds, on the test set. In
addition, describe and implement the cross-validation approach to estimate the test dataset
model performance measurements.
(c) Plot the ROC for a logistic model on a graph and compute the AUC. Explain the information
conveyed by the ROC and the AUC metrics.

3.
a) Fit three alternative machine learning models (e.g., classification tree, bagging,
random forest models; KNN or SVM algorithms) in the data and comment on the
performance of these models. Which model would you choose and why?
b) How do these models perform compared to the fitted logistic regression model in question
2?

4.
a) Evaluate the potential, from theoretical and empirical perspectives, of the following unsupervised
learning techniques to improve (or not) the predictive modeling work you have reported.
Techniques
1. Principal Components Analysis
2. K-Means Clustering
3. Hierarchical Clustering
